=== Introduction of WIS2

==== Why WIS2?

The WMO Information System (WIS) provides high-performance and reliable data sharing for all WMO Programmes. WIS2 evolves the original solution that became operational in 2012 in response to technical advances, increases in data volumes, and increased diversity in the people and systems that seek to consume data generated, curated, and shared by WMO Programmes.

From a business requirements perspective, WIS2 supports the following initiatives:

. Response to emerging data issues.
. Support for implementation of the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON).
. Support for implementation of the WMO Unified Data Policy (WMO Res. 1).
. Improved support for WMO Programmes beyond the World Weather Watch.
. Enabling low barrier and open access to weather, water, and climate data.

These business requirements translate into the following functional requirements:

. Use of open standards.
. Simple Dataset discovery.
. Integration with the World Wide Web.
. Provision of cloud-ready solutions.
. Enablement  of big data sharing.
. Replacement of the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).

Four Technical Foundations are central to how WIS evolved to meet these business and functional requirements:

. Scalable Web-services architecture.
. Dataset discovery using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) API Records standard.
. Real-time notifications about data availability using the OASIS MQTT messaging protocol.
. Unified monitoring using the OpenMetrics cloud-native, highly scalable metrics protocol (IETF draft)

Underpinning these WIS2 Technical Foundations are the Principles of WIS2. These are described in Appendix A to the Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol II. WIS2.

==== What is WIS2?

WIS2 is a federated "system of systems". All WIS Centres will comply with the Technical Regulations defined in the Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060) with regards to how they share data in support of WMO Programme objectives.

In addition, Global Information System Centres (GISC) coordinate the operation of WIS within their Area of Responsibility (AoR) and collectively provide Global Services that ensure highly available data sharing within the WIS2 ecosystem.

The list of NCs, DCPCs, and GISCs is available in Appendix D to the Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol II. WIS2: Approved WIS Centres footnote:[As of October 2022 the list of approved WIS centres is empty because none have been formally designated as WIS2 centres, having completing the migration from WIS/GTS to WIS2. For designated "WIS 1" centres please refer to Appendix B of the Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol I.].

When describing the functions of WIS2 there are 3 roles to consider:

. Data Publisher: 
* This role is fulfilled by NC and DCPC.
* Data Publishers operate a "WIS node" to share their data within the WIS2 ecosystem.
* Data Publishers manage, curate, and provide access to one or more "Datasets".
* For each Dataset, a Data Publisher provides: 
  i) "Discovery metadata" to describe the Dataset, provide details on how it can be accessed, and under what conditions.
  ii) An API or Web-service to access (or interact with) the Dataset.
  iii) Notification messages advertising the availability of new data and metadata.

. Global Coordinator: 
* This role is exclusive to GISCs.
* All GISCs supporting WMO Members in their AoR fulfil their data sharing obligations via WIS2.
* Sufficient to provide highly available global coverage, a GISC may operate one or more Global Services – 
  i) Global Discovery Catalogue: enables users (humans and software agents) to search all Datasets provided by Data Publishers and discover where and how to interact with those Datasets (e.g., subscribe to updates, access/download/visualize data, or access more detailed information about the Dataset).
  ii) Global Broker: provides highly available messaging services where users may subscribe to notifications about all Datasets provided by Data Publishers.
  iii) Global Cache: provides highly available download service for cached copies of core data downloaded from Data Publishers’ Web-services.
  iv) Global Monitor: gathers and displays system performance, data availability, and other metrics from all WIS nodes and Global Services.

. Data Consumer:
* This role represents anyone wanting to find, access, and use data from WIS2 – examples include (but are not limited to): NMHS, government agency, research institution, private sector organisation, etc.
* Searches or browses the Global Discovery Catalogue (or other search engine) to discover the Dataset(s) that meet their needs (i.e., "Datasets of interest").
* Subscribes via the Global Broker to receive notification messages about the availability of data or metadata associated with Datasets of interest.
* Determines whether the data or metadata referenced in notification messages is required.
* Downloads data from Global Cache or WIS node.

"Quickstart" guidance is provided in Quickstarts TODO: ref for each of these roles.

More details on these aspects are provided in Manual on WIS (WMO No. 1060), Vol II. Part III. Functions of WIS. Section 3.2 (Functional Architecture of WIS) provides a simple overview of how WIS2 functions 

==== Why are datasets so important?

The purpose of WIS is to enable sharing of data. "Datasets" provide the mechanism for us to describe what data we publish, or what data we’re interested in.

Data comes in all shapes and sizes. Often, our data is continually updated (e.g., new observations from an automatic weather station). Sometimes it is very, very big (e.g., a set of climate predictions or a multi-decadal reanalysis). WIS2 aims to make it simple to talk about collections of data that share similar characteristics.

We call these collections of data "Datasets".

A Dataset may comprise of thousands of individual files – like scene from an imaging satellite, or fields from a numerical weather prediction model. Or it may comprise huge numbers of records in a database – like a time-series of physical property values observed at numerous locations. 

However, the data is stored, we describe the collection of files, records, whatever (!) as a Dataset. But there are some rules. The data in a Dataset must be consistent – it must have the same type (e.g., time-series at point locations), subject (e.g., observations of physical properties), and any spatiotemporal referencing so that people can structure sensible queries on the Dataset. A Dataset must also have a single usage or access policy, which implies a Dataset will be subject to a single governance regime and will likely have a single owner. Most importantly, the contents of a Dataset must be available from a single access point so that we can tell Data Consumers where they can download data from. We also need to use a single topic for publishing notifications about the availability of new data within a Dataset.

It is up to Data Publishers to decide how they group data into Datasets. That said, we recommend that, subject to the consistency rules, Data Publishers should organise their data into as few Datasets as possible. For a Data Publisher this means fewer discovery metadata records to maintain. For a Data Consumer this means fewer topics to subscribe to, and lower barrier APIs and Web services to access.

A real-world example for an NMHS to package all synoptic observations for the entire country or territory into a single Dataset footnote:[Probably keep archived synoptic observations separate from those being collected in (near) real-time because they’re likely accessed through different Web-services.] footnote:[This is contrary to earlier practices in WIS where each GTS bulletin was considered a Dataset. This meant that the WIS Catalogue became overburdened with hundreds of thousands of records, each describing more-or-less the same thing. The result was a very poor search experience – always too many ‘hits’!]. Described with a single discovery metadata record. Accessible via a single Web-service.

Finally, note that the notification messages used to advertise the availability of new data themselves contain metadata (time, location, etc.). This allows for Data Consumers to decide whether or not they want to download a specific file or record.
