=== 2.6 Implementation and operation of a WIS2 Node

==== 2.6.1 Practices and procedures

===== 2.6.1.1 Registration and decommissioning of a WIS2 Node

The registration and decommissioning of WIS2 Nodes must be approved by the Permanent Representative (PR) with WMO of the country or territory where the WIS centre is located. The WIS National Focal Point (NFP) can register a WIS2 Node on behalf of the PR for an official NC or DCPC listed in the Manual on WIS, Volume I. Where the WIS2 Node is part of a DCPC, the sponsoring WMO programme or regional association shall be consulted.

A WIS2 Node can be registered to exchange data concerning a WMO project or campaign for a limited time. The WIS NFP can register such a project-related WIS2 Node in coordination with the WMO Secretariat.

A WIS2 Node can act as a publication facility on behalf of other centres. This is a Data Collection or Production Centre (DCPC) role, as defined in the Manual on WIS. Data or metadata publication by a DCPC will use the centre identifiers of the data producers.

The WMO Secretariat will maintain a WIS2 register  with an authoritative list of WIS2 Nodes and Global Services. 

The registration of a WIS2 Node involves the following steps:

* Request to host a WIS2 Node: A request to host a WIS2 Node shall be put forward by the WIS NFP of the country of the WIS2 Node host centre, or, in the case of international organizations, by either the PR with WMO of the country or territory where the centre is located or the president of the relevant organization, if the WMO partner or programme is designated as a DCPC.

* Assign a centre identifier (“centre-id”): The centre-id is an acronym proposed by the Member and endorsed by the WMO Secretariat. It is a single identifier consisting of a top-level domain (TLD) and a centre name and represents the data publisher, distributor or issuing centre of a given dataset or data product/granule (see the Manual on WIS, Volume II – Appendix D. WIS2 Topic Hierarchy). See guidance on assigning a centre identifier 
(<<_2_6_1_2_guidance_on_assigning_a_centre_identifier_for_a_wis2_node>>).

* Complete the WIS2 register: The WIS NFP shall complete the WIS2 register maintained by the WMO Secretariat.
* Provide details of the Global Service: The WMO Secretariat provides connection details (such as IP addresses) for the Global Services so that the WIS2 Node can be configured to provide access. 
* WIS2 Node assessment: The principal GISC verifies that the WIS2 Node is compliant with WIS2 requirements. This assessment includes:
  - Verification of compliance of the topics used by the centre with the WTH specification;
  - Verification of compliance of notification messages with the WIS2 Notification Message (WNM) specification;
  - Verification that the data server is correctly configured and properly functioning;
  - Verification that the Message Broker is correctly configured and properly functioning.
* Add a new centre to WIS2: Upon completion of the verification and confirmation that the centre satisfies all the conditions for operating a WIS2 Node, the GISC notifies the WMO Secretariat and confirms that the centre can be added to WIS2 as a WIS2 Node.
* Communicate the details to the Global Services: The WMO Secretariat provides the details of the WIS2 Node to the Global Brokers so that they can subscribe to the WIS2 Node.

A diagram of the process for registering a WIS2 Node is presented below (see Figure 1).

Once a WIS2 Node has been registered and connected to the Global Services, it can proceed to register the datasets it will publish via WIS2. To register a dataset, the WIS2 Node publishes discovery metadata about the new dataset. Validation of the discovery metadata is completed by the Global Discovery Catalogues, and the Global Brokers automatically subscribe to the topics provided in the discovery metadata record. For more information, see <<_1_3_2_how_to_provide_discovery_metadata_to_wis2>>.

Once the dataset has been successfully registered, the WIS2 Node can proceed to exchange data - see 
<<_1_3_3_how_to_provide_data_in_wis2>>.

When decommissioning a WIS2 Node, operators must ensure that obligations relating to data sharing within WIS continue to be met after the WIS2 Node is decommissioned, for example, by migrating the data sharing obligations to another WIS2 Node. In the case of a DCPC, this may mean transferring the responsibilities to another Member.

===== 2.6.1.2 Guidance on assigning a centre identifier for a WIS2 Node

The centre identifier (``centre-id``) is used in WIS2 to uniquely identify a participating WIS2 Node. The ``centre-id`` must conform to the specifications given in the _Manual on WIS_, Volume II - Appendix D. WIS2 Topic Hierarchy, section 7.1.6 Centre identification.

The ``centre-id`` comprises two dash-separated tokens.

*Token 1* is a Top Level Domain (TLD) defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).footnote:[See IANA TLDs: https://data.iana.org/TLD.]

It is usually fairly easy for a Member to choose a TLD. However, for Members’ overseas territories, this may require some thought. The recommended approach depends on the governance structure of the overseas territory. For example, Réunion is a French Department; it is considered part of France, and it uses the Euro. Réunion would use the “fr” TLD. New Caledonia is a French overseas territory with a TLD of “nc” because it has a separate, devolved governance structure. The recommendation is to use “nc”. However, the decision of which TLD to use is made at the national level.

*Token 2* is a descriptive name for the centre. It may contain dashes, but it may not contain other special characters.
 
The descriptive name should be something recognizable – not only by the WIS2 community, but also by other users. Basing the name on the web domain name is likely to ensure that centre identifiers remain unique within a particular country or territory. For example, the National Meteorological Service of the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Northern Ireland is the Met Office,footnote:[See http://www.metoffice.gov.uk.] so “metoffice” is better than “ukmo”.footnote:[The “.gov” part of the domain name is superfluous for the purposes of WIS2 There is nothing preventing its use, but it does not add any value.]. Using a four-letter GTS centre identifier (for example, CCCC) is not recommended because those who are unfamiliar with GTS will not understand these identifiers.

The centre identifier specification says that larger organizations operating multiple centres may wish to register separate centre-ids for each centre. This is a good practice. Keeping with the UK example, the Met Office operates a National Meteorological Centre (NMC), 9 DCPCs (for example, a Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre) and a WIS2 Global Service, so it is important to separate them. For example:

* ``uk-metoffice-nmc``;
* ``uk-metoffice-vaac``;
* ``uk-metoffice-global-cache``.  
 
It is not advisable to use a system name in the centre-id because system names may change over time. Functional designations are durable over the long term. Test WIS2 Nodes may be designated by adding “-test” to the descriptive name.

===== 2.6.1.3 Authentication, authorization, and access control for a WIS2 Node

When configuring a WIS2 Node, it is necessary to consider how it will be accessed by Global Services and data consumers.

Global Brokers must authenticate when they connect to the MQTT Message Broker in the WIS2 Node. Username and password credentials are used.footnote:[The default connection credentials for a WIS2 Node Message Broker are username ``everyone`` and password ``everyone`` WIS2 Node operators should choose credentials that meet their local policies (for example, password complexity).]. When registering the WIS2 Node with the WMO Secretariat, these credentials must be provided. The WMO Secretariat will share the credentials with the Global Service operators and store them in the WIS register. These credentials should not be considered confidential or secret.

Given that Global Brokers republish notification messages provided by the WIS2 Node, access to the MQTT Message Broker may be restricted. Global Brokers operate using a fixed IP address, which allows access to be granted using IP filtering.footnote:[In WIS2, IP addresses are used to determine the origin of connections and confer trust to remote systems. It is well documented that IP addresses can be hijacked and that more sophisticated mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), are available for reliably determining the origin of connection requests. However, the complexities of implementing such mechanisms create barriers to Member participation in WIS2. For the purposes of WIS2, which involves distributing publicly accessible data and messages, IP addresses are considered to provide an adequate level of trust.] MQTT Message Brokers must be accessible by more than one Global Broker to ensure resilient transmission of notification messages to WIS2.

If your WIS2 Node only publishes core data,footnote:[In some cases, WIS2 Nodes will need to serve core data directly (see <<_1_3_3_5_considerations_when_providing_core_data_in_wis2>>). In these situations, the WIS2 Node data server must remain publicly accessible.] access to the data server may also be restricted, with the distribution of data handled by Global Caches. Global Caches also operate on fixed IP addresses, allowing their connections to be easily identified. Again, access must be granted to more than one Global Broker to ensure resilience.

During registration, the WMO Secretariat will provide host names and IP addresses of the Global Services to enable access controls to be configured.

Access controls may be implemented for recommended data. Only the security schemes for authentication and authorization specified in OpenAPI should be used.footnote:[See OpenAPI Specification - Security Scheme Object: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#security-scheme-object.]

==== 2.6.2 Performance management

===== 2.6.2.1 Service levels and performance indicators

A WIS2 Node must be able to publish datasets, compliant metadata and discovery metadata. This entails:
  * Publishing metadata to the Global Data Catalogue;
  * Publishing core data to the Global Cache;
  * Publishing data for consumer access;
  * Publishing data embedded in a message (for example, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) warnings);
  * Receiving metadata publication errors from the Global Data Catalogue;
  * Providing metadata with topics to Global Brokers.

===== 2.6.2.2 System performance metrics

If contacted by a Global Monitor for a performance issue via a GISC, the WIS2 Node should provide metrics to the GISC and the Global Monitor when service is restored to inform them of the resolution of the issue.

==== 2.6.3 WIS2 Node reference implementation: WIS2 in a box

When providing a WIS2 Node, Members may use whichever software components they consider most appropriate to comply with the WIS2 technical regulations.

To assist Members, a free and open-source reference implementation called “WIS2 in a box” (wis2box) is available. wis2box implements the requirements for a WIS2 Node and contains additional enhancements. wis2box is built free and open-source software components that are mature, robust and widely adopted for operational use.

wis2box provides the functionality required for both data publisher and data consumer roles, as well as the following technical functions:

* Configuration, generation and publication of data (real-time or archive) and metadata to WIS2, compliant to WIS2 Node requirements
* MQTT Message Broker and notification message publication (subscribe);
* HTTP object storage and raw data access (download);
* Station metadata curation/editing tools (user interface);
* Discovery metadata curation/editing tools (user interface);
* Data entry tools (user interface);
* OGC API server, providing dynamic APIs for discovery, access, visualization and processing functionality (APIs);
* Extensible data "pipelines", allowing for the transformation, processing and publishing of additional data types;
* Provision of system performance and data availability metrics;
* Access control for publication of recommended data, as required;
* Subscription to notifications and download of WIS data from Global Services;
* Modular design, which allows for extensibility to meet additional requirements or integration with existing data management systems.

The project documentation can be found at https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int.

wis2box is managed as a free and open source project.  The source code, issue tracking and discussions are hosted openly on GitHub: https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2box.
