==== Interoperability with existing systems

The WIS2 priciples enable lowering the barrier to weather/climate/water data for WMO members.  Lowering the barrier is driven by **international standards**
for data discovery, access, and visualization.  In addition to Member benefits, a by-product of utilizing standards is being able to provide
the same data and access mechanisms to external systems at no extra cost of implementation.

WIS2 standards are based on industry standards (OGC, W3C, IETF) and allow for **broad** interoperabliilty.  This means that non-traditional users can also
use data from WIS2 data in the same manner, without the requirement for specialized software, tools, or applications.
