=== 2.8 Operations

==== 2.8.1 Interoperability with external systems

The WIS2 principles enable lowering the barrier to weather/climate/water data for WMO Members.  Lowering the barrier is driven by international standards
for data discovery, access, and visualization.  In addition to Member benefits, a by-product of utilizing standards is being able to provide
the same data and access mechanisms to external systems at no extra cost of implementation.

WIS2 standards are based on industry standards (OGC, W3C, IETF) and allow for broad interoperablility.  This means that non-traditional users can also
use data from WIS2 data in the same manner, without the requirement for specialized software, tools, or applications.

===== 2.8.1.1 Publishing meteorological data through WIS2 into ICAO SWIM

Meteorological data is an essential input for public weather services
and aviation services alike. WIS2 provides the mechanism for data exchange
in WMO, while SWIM is the ICAO initiative to harmonize the provision of aeronautical, meteorological and flight information to support air traffic management (ATM).

Both WIS2 and SWIM support similar outcomes relating to data
exchange. However, there are differences in both approach and
implementation.

Specifications for WIS2 are defined in the _Manual on WIS_, Volume II, and further elaborated in this Guide. Specifications for SWIM will be defined in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services –Information Management (PANS-IM) (ICAO Doc. 10199)footnote:[The PANS-IM is expected to available on ICAO NET by July 2024 and become applicable in November 2024. Information provided in herein is based on best understanding of draft proposals from ICAO.].

During the WIS2 transition phase (2025-2033), meteorological data published
via WIS2 will automatically be published to the GTS via the WIS2-to-GTS gateways.

|===
|*WIS2* |*SWIM*
|Earth-system scope: weather, climate, hydrology, atmospheric
composition, cryosphere, ocean and space weather data |ATM scope: aeronautical, meteorological and flight information

|Data centric - a consumer discovers data and then determines the
services through which that data may be accessed |Service centric - a
consumer discovers a service (or service provider) and determines what
resources (that is, information) is available therein

|Technical protocols: MQTT, HTTP |Technical protocols:
AMQPfootnote:[AMQP 1.0 is one of the protocols proposed in the draft PANS-IM]
|===

An organization (for example, the National Meteorological Service) that is
responsible for providing meteorological data to WIS2 may be designated by the ICAO Contracting State as a responsible entity to provide aeronautical meteorological information into SWIM.
Where requirements dictate, the organization may provide regional
capability on behalf of a group of countries or territories.

This section of the Guide outlines how such an organization may efficiently fulfil the requirements in providing required data/information to the two systems. It proposes an
interoperability approach between WIS2 and SWIM where meteorological
data published via WIS2 can be automatically propagated to SWIM.

This Guide covers only how data from WIS2 can be published into SWIM.
Consumption of information from SWIM services is not in scope.

This Guide also does not cover implementation details of the SWIM
service - including, but not limited to:

* Mechanisms used by SWIM to discover service providers and services.
* Specification of the SWIM data message.
* AMQP message broker configuration.
* Operation, logging and monitoring.
* Cybersecurity considerations for the provision of SWIM services.

This Guide will be updated as more information is made available from
ICAO and/or recommended practices are updated.

Finally, it should be noted that the provision of aeronautical meteorological information and its exchange via the ICAO
Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS) is also out of scope as they are solely defined under the ICAO regulatory framework.

====== 2.8.1.1.1 WIS2 to SWIM gateway

The WIS2 to SWIM interoperability approach employs a gateway component (as per the figure below):

.Schematic of an interoperability approach
image::images/wis2-to-swim-temp.png[Schematic of interoperability approach]

The gateway can operate as an "adapter" between WIS2 and SWIM by pulling
the requisite meteorological data from WIS2 and re-publishing it
to SWIM.

====== 2.8.1.1.2 Data types and format

Specifications for aeronautical meteorological information are provided in ICAO
Annex 3 and other relevant guidance materials. The ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model (IWXXM) format (FM 205)footnote:[IWXXM (FM205) is defined in the _Manual on Codes_ (WMO-No. 306), Volume I.3 – International Codes] is to be used for encoding aeronautical meteorological information in SWIM.

====== 2.8.1.1.3 Publishing meteorological data via WIS2
For meteorological data to be published from WIS2 to SWIM, the organization
responsible for this provision will need to operate a WIS2 Node and
comply with the pertinent technical regulations as specified in the
_Manual on WIS_, Volume II. Onward distribution of the
data by the Message Broker over SWIM can be handled by the
respective Information Service Provider in accordance with ICAO
Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).

The responsible organization should consider whether this
data should be published via an existing WIS2 Node, or whether a separate
WIS2 Node should be established. For example, the data may be
provided by a separate operational unit, or there may be a requirement to easily
distinguish between data for SWIM and any other meteorological data.

Where a new WIS2 Node is needed, the responsible organization must
establish a new WIS2 Node and register it with the WMO Secretariat. For more information, see <<_2_6_implementation_and_operation_of_a_wis2_node>>.

Datasets are a central concept in WIS2. Where
meteorological data is published via WIS2, it will be packaged into
“datasets”. The data should be grouped at the country/territory
level; (for instance, datasets should be published for a given country/territory), one for each datatype (for example,
aerodrome observation, aerodrome forecast and quantitative volcanic ash
concentration information).

For the purposes of publishing through WIS2, datasets containing aeronautical meteorological information should be considered as "recommended data", as
described in Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)).
The recommended data category of the policy is intended to cover data
that should be exchanged by Members to support Earth system monitoring
and prediction efforts.

Recommended data:

* May be subject to conditions on use and reuse.
* May have access controlsfootnote:[WIS2 follows the recommendations
from OpenAPI regarding choice of security schemes for authenticated
access - a choice of HTTP authentication, API keys, OAuth2 or OpenID
Connect Discovery. For more information see
OpenAPI Security Scheme Object: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#security-scheme-object]footnote:[WIS2 does not provide any guidance on use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).] applied at the WIS2 Node.
* Are not cached within WIS2 by the Global Cachesfootnote:[Global
Caches enable highly available, low-latency distribution of core data.
Given that core data is provided on a free and unrestricted basis,
Global Caches do not implement any data access control.].

Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)) requires transparency on the conditions of use for recommended data. Conditions regarding the use of aeronautical meteorological information are specified in ICAO Annex 3 and, optionally, by the ICAO Contracting State. Such conditions of use should be explicitly stated in the discovery metadata for each dataset as described below.

* The attribute ``wmo:dataPolicy`` should be set to ``recommended``.
* Information about conditions of use should be specified using a ``rights`` property (see example below) and/or a ``link`` object with a relation ``license``.
* Information about access control should be specified using a ``security`` object in the ``link`` object describing the data access details.

.Example expression of conditions relating to the use of aeronautical meteorological information:
[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "rights": "This information is freely disseminated for the purposes of safety of international air navigation. ICAO Annex 3"
  ...
}
----
 
For more information on the WMO Core Metadata Profile version 2, see the
_Manual on WIS_, Volume II, Appendix F.

On receipt of new data, the WIS2 Node will:

1. Publish the data as a resource via a Web server (or Web service).
2. Publish a WIS2 Notification Message to a local message broker that
advertises the availability of the data resource.

Note that, in contrast to the GTS, WIS2 publishes data resources
individually, each with an associated notification message. WIS2 does
not group data resources into bulletins.

The data resource is identified using a URL. The notification message
refers to the data resource using this URLfootnote:[Where the data
resource does not exceed 4 Kb, it may additionally be embedded in the
notification message.].

For more details on the WIS2 Notification Message, see the _Manual on WIS_, Volume II, Appendix E: WIS2 Notification Message.

The notification message must be published to the proper topic on the
Message Broker. WIS2 defines a standard topic hierarchy to ensure
that data is published consistently by all WIS2 Nodes. Notification
messages for aviation data should be published on a specific topic
allowing a data consumer, such as the gateway, to subscribe only to
aviation-specific notifications. See the example below:

.Example topic used to publish notifications about Quantitative Volcanic Ash Concentration Information
[source,text]
----
origin/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/recommended/weather/aviation/qvaci
----

For more details of the WIS Topic Hierarchy, see the _Manual on WIS_, Volume II, Appendix D: WIS2 Topic Hierarchy.

WIS Global Brokers subscribe to the local message brokers of WIS2 Nodes
and republish notification messages for global distribution.

As a minimum, the WIS2 Node should retain the aviation data for a
duration that meets the needs of the gateway. A retention period of at
least 24 hours is recommended.

====== 2.8.1.4 gateway implementation

The potential interactions between the gateway component, WIS2 and SWIM are
illustrated in the figure belowfootnote:[Note that the figure simplifies
the transmission of discovery metadata from WIS2 Node to the Global
Discovery Catalogue. The WIS2 Node publishes notification
messages advertising the availability of new discovery metadata resource
at a given URL. These messages are republished by the Global Broker. The
Global Discovery Catalogue subscribes to a Global Broker and downloads
the discovery metadata from the WIS2 Node using the URL supplied in the
message.]

.Interactions between the gateway and components of WIS2 and SWIM
image::images/wis2-to-swim-interaction-temp.png[Interactions between the gateway and components of WIS2 and SWIM]

**Configuration**

Dataset discovery metadata will provide
useful information that can be used to configure the gateway, for example, the
topic(s) to subscribe to plus various other information that may be
needed for the SWIM service.

Discovery metadata can be downloaded from the Global Discovery Catalogue.

**Functions**

The gateway component implements the following functions:

* Subscribe to the pertinent topic(s) for notifications about new
aeronautical meteorological informationfootnote:[WIS2 recommends that one subscribes to
notifications from a Global Broker. However, where both gateway and WIS2
Node are operated by the same organization, it may be advantageous to
subscribe directly to the local message broker of WIS2 Node, for example, to
reduce latency.].
* On receipt of notification messages about newly available data:
** Parse the notification message, discarding duplicate messages already
processed previously;
** Download the data resource from the WIS2
Nodefootnote:[The WIS2 Node may control access to data - the gateway will
need to be implemented accordingly.] using the URL in the message - the
resource should be in IWXXM format;
** Create a new "data message" as per the SWIM specifications, including
the unique identifier extracted from the data resourcefootnote:[In case
a unique identifier is required for proper passing of an aviation
weather message to the gateway, one can use the GTS abbreviated heading
(TTAAii CCCC YYGGgg) in the COLLECT envelop (available in IWXXM messages
having a corresponding TAC message), or content in attribute
``gml:identifier`` (available in newer IWXXM messages like WAFS SIGWX
Forecast and QVACI), for such purpose. There is currently no agreed
definition for unique identifier of IWXXM METAR and TAF reports of
individual aerodrome.], and embedding the aviation weather data resource
within the data message;
** Publish the data message to the appropriate topic on the SWIM Message
Broker component of the SWIM service.

The choice of protocol for publishing to the SWIM Message Broker should
be based on bilateral agreement between operators of the gateway and
SWIM service.

The gateway should implement logging and error handling as necessary to
enable reliable operations. WIS2 uses the OpenMetrics
standardfootnote:[OpenMetrics:
https://openmetrics.io] for
publishing metrics and other operating information. Use of OpenMetrics
by the gateway would enable monitoring and performance reporting to be
easily integrated into the WIS2 system.

**Operation**

The gateway may be operated at national or regional level depending on
the organizational governance in place.

====== 2.8.1.1.5 SWIM service

The SWIM aviation weather information service may comprise of a Message Broker
component which implements the AMQP 1.0 messaging standardfootnote:[AMQP
1.0: https://www.amqp.org/resources/specifications].

The Message Broker publishes the data messages provided by the gateway.

The Message Broker must ensure that data messages are provided only by
authorized sources such as a gateway and should validate incoming messages as aeronautical meteorological information.

===== 2.8.1.2 The Ocean Data and Information System

The Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS) is a federation of 
independent data systems coordinated by the International Oceanographic 
Data and Information Exchange (IODE) of IOC-UNESCO. This federation 
includes continental-scale data systems as well as those of small 
organizations. ODIS partners use web architectural approaches to share 
metadata describing their holdings, services, and other capacities. In 
brief, IODE publishes guidelines on how to share metadata as linked open 
data, serialized in JSON-LD using schema.orgfootnote:[https://schema.org]
semantics. ODIS nodes use these guidelines to publish their metadata 
catalogues on the Web. This allows all systems with web connectivity to 
harvest and merge these catalogues, creating a global map of the ocean 
data. IODE harvests all metadata shared by ODIS partners, combines 
it as a knowledge graph, and processes this to export derivative 
products (for example, diagnostic reports and cloud-optimised data products). 
The Ocean InfoHub (OIH) system is IODE's reference implementation of a 
discovery system leveraging ODIS. The ODIS architecture and tools are
free and open-source (FOSS), with regular releases published for the
community.

To reach beyond the oceans domain, ODIS works with other data systems and 
federations, such as WIS2, to define sustainable data and metadata exchanges 
and - where needed - translators or converters. The resources needed to 
convert between such systems are developed in the open and in close
collaboration with staff from those systems. These exchanges include
extract transform load (ETL) functions, to ensure that the bilateral exchange is mutually beneficial.

====== 2.8.1.2.1 Cross system interoperability

Given the strong support for standards and interoperability by both WIS2
and ODIS, data and metadata exchange is realized using web architectural
principles and approaches. The ability to discover ODIS data on WIS2 (as well
as the inverse) is a goal in extending the reach of both systems and data
beyond their primary communities of interest.

The WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogue will provide discovery metadata records
using the OGC API - Records standard. This will include schema.org and JSON-LD
annotations on WCMP2 discovery metadata in the GDC, to enable cross-pollination
and federation.

ODIS dataset records will be made available using the WCMP2 standard and provided
as objects available via HTTP for ingest, validation and publication to the GDC as a
federated catalogue.  ODIS data will be published as recommended data as per Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)).

.WIS2 and ODIS metadata and catalogue interoperability
image::images/wis2-odis-metadata-discovery-interop.png[WIS2 and ODIS metadata and catalogue interoperability]

As a result, federated discovery will be realized between both systems, allowing for
use and reuse of data in an authoritative manner, closest to the source of the data.
