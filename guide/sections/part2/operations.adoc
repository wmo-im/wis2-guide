==== Interoperability with external systems

The WIS2 priciples enable lowering the barrier to weather/climate/water data for WMO members.  Lowering the barrier is driven by **international standards**
for data discovery, access, and visualization.  In addition to Member benefits, a by-product of utilizing standards is being able to provide
the same data and access mechanisms to external systems at no extra cost of implementation.

WIS2 standards are based on industry standards (OGC, W3C, IETF) and allow for **broad** interoperabliilty.  This means that non-traditional users can also
use data from WIS2 data in the same manner, without the requirement for specialized software, tools, or applications.

===== Publishing aviation weather data through WIS2 into ICAO SWIM

====== Introduction

Meteorological data is an essential input for public weather services
and aviation services alike. WMO and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specify the respective data
sharing arrangements. WIS2 provides the mechanism for data exchange
in WMO, while SWIM (System Wide Information Management) is the ICAO
initiative to harmonize exchange of aeronautical, weather and flight
information for the air traffic management industry.

Both WIS2 and SWIM support the similar outcomes relating to data
exchange. However, there are differences in both approach and
implementation.

Specifications for WIS2 are defined in the Manual on WIS (WMO-No.
1060), Volume II, and further elaborated in this Guide. Specifications
for SWIM will be defined in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services –
Information Management (PANS-IM) (ICAO Doc. 10199). Publication of
PANS-IM is anticipated by July 2024 on ICAO-NET, with applicability from
November 2024. Information provided herein is based on best
understanding of the draft proposals from ICAO.

|*WIS2* |*SWIM*
|Earth-system scope: weather, climate, hydrology, atmospheric
composition, cryosphere, ocean and space weather data |Air traffic
management scope: aeronautical, weather and flight data

|Data centric - a consumer discovers data and then determines the
services through which that data may be accessed |Service centric - a
consumer discovers a service (or service provider) and determines what
resources (i.e., data) is available therein

|Technical protocols: MQTT, HTTP |Technical protocols:
AMQPfootnote:[AMQP 1.0 is proposed in the draft PANS-IM]
|===

A single organisation (i.e., the National Meteorological Service) may be
responsible for providing meteorological data to both WIS2 and SWIM.
Where requirements dictate, the organisation may provide regional
capability on behalf of a group of countries or territories.

This section of the Guide outlines how such an organisation may reduce
the burden in publishing data to the two systems. It proposes an
interoperability approach between WIS2 and SWIM where aviation
weather data published via WIS2 is automatically propagated to SWIM.

This Guide covers only how information is published into SWIM.
Consumption of data from SWIM services is not in scope at this time.

This Guide also does not cover implementation details of the SWIM
service - including, but not limited to:

* Mechanisms used by SWIM to discover service providers and services.
* Specification of the SWIM data message.
* AMQP message broker configuration.
* Operation, logging and monitoring.
* Cybersecurity considerations for provision of SWIM services.

This Guide will be updated as more information is made available from
ICAO and/or recommended practices are updated.

//TODO: update as needed after feedback
Finally, note that provision of aviation weather data via the
Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS) is also out of scope. During the WIS2 transition phase (2025-2030), this provision will continue via the
Global Telecommunications System (GTS). Aviation weather data published
via WIS2 will automatically be published to the GTS via the WIS2 WIS2-to-GTS Gateways.

====== WIS2 to SWIM Gateway

The WIS2 to SWIM interoperability approach employs a Gateway
component (figure 1).

{empty}[Figure 1: Schematic of interoperability approach]

The Gateway operates as an "adapter" between WIS2 and SWIM, pulling
the requisite aviation weather data from WIS2 and re-publishing it
via a SWIM service.

====== Data types and format

Initial SWIM services are expected to include, but are not limited to:

[arabic]
* Aerodrome Observation (METAR)
* Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)
* Quantitative Volcanic Ash Concentration Information (QVACI)

Specifications for these aviation data types are provided in ICAO
manuals, and include IWXXM format (FM 205) as specified in Manual on
Codes, Volume I.3 - International Codes (WMO-No. 306).

====== Publishing aviation weather data via WIS2

For aviation weather data to be published via WIS2, the organisation
responsible for this provision will need to operate a WIS Node and
comply with the pertinent Technical Regulations as specified in the
Manual on WIS (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II. Onward distribution of aviation
weather data by the Message Broker over SWIM will be handled by the
respective Information Service Provider in accordance with ICAO
Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).

The responsible organisation should consider whether aviation weather
data should be published via an existing WIS2 Node, or whether a separate
WIS2 Node should be established. For example, aviation data may be
provided by a separate operational unit, or one may wish to easily
distinguish between aviation-specific data and data published by the NMC
for general use.

Where a new WIS2 Node is needed, the responsible organisation must
register a ``centre-id`` for the WIS2 Node. For more information on
``centre-id``, see Manual on WIS (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II, Appendix E.

Datasets are a central concept in WIS2. Where aviation weather
information is published via WIS2, it shall be packaged into
“Datasets”. The information should be grouped at the country / territory
level; i.e., datasets should be published for a given country /
territory (or "State" in ICAO parlance), one for each datatype (e.g.,
aerodrome observation, aerodrome forecast and quantitative volcanic ash
concentration information).

These Datasets should be considered as "*Recommended Data*", as
described in the WMO Unified Data Policy, Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)).
The Recommended Data category of the policy is intended to cover data
that should be exchanged by Members to support Earth system monitoring
and prediction efforts.

Recommended Data:

* May be subject to conditions on use and re-use.
* May have access controlsfootnote:[WIS2 follows the recommendations
from OpenAPI regarding choice of security schemes for authenticated
access - a choice of HTTP authentication, API keys, OAuth2 or OpenID
Connect Discovery. For more information see
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/[[.underline]#https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#].
WIS2 does not provide any guidance on use of Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI).] applied at the WIS Node.
* Are *not* cached within WIS2 by the Global Cachesfootnote:[Global
Caches enable highly available, low-latency distribution of Core Data.
Given that Core Data is provided on a free and unrestricted basis,
Global Caches *do not* implement any data access control.].

The responsible organisation must publish discovery metadata for each dataset. Note that:

* The attribute ``wmo:dataPolicy`` should be set to ``recommended``.
* Information about conditions of use should be specified using a ``links`` object with a ``security`` property.

The ICAO Working Group on MET Cost Recovery Governance and Guidance
(WG-MCRGG) is currently developing the licenses appropriate for aviation
weather information.

For more information on the WMO Core Metadata Profile version 2, see
Manual on WIS (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II, Appendix F.

On receipt of new data, the WIS2 Node will:

. Publish the data as a resource via a Web server (or Web service).
. Publish a WIS2 Notification Message to a local message broker that
advertises the availability of the data resource.

Note that, in contrast to the GTS, WIS2 publishes data resources
individually, each with an associated notification message. WIS2 does
not group data resources into bulletins.

The WIS Node should publish aviation weather data in IWXXM format.

The data resource is identified using a URL. The notification message
refers to the data resource using the URLfootnote:[Where the data
resource does not exceed 4Kb, it may additionally be embedded in the
notification message.].

For more details on the WIS Notification Message, see Manual on WIS
(WMO-No. 1060), Volume II, Appendix F.

The notification message must be published to the proper topic on the
message broker. WIS2 defines a standard topic hierarchy to ensure
that data is published consistently by all WIS Nodes. Notification
messages for aviation data should be published on a specific topic
allowing a data consumer, such as the Gateway, to subscribe only to
aviation-specific notifications. See the example below:

.Example Topic used to publish notifications about Quantitative Volcanic Ash Concentration Information
[source,text]
----
origin/a/wis2/{centre-id}/data/recommended/weather/aviation/qvaci
----

For more details of the WIS Topic Hierarchy, see Manual on WIS (WMO-No.
1060), Volume II, Appendix E.

WIS Global Brokers subscribe to the local message brokers of WIS2 Nodes
and republish notification messages for global distribution.

As a minimum, the WIS2 Node should retain the aviation data for a
duration that meets the needs of the Gateway. The retention period of at
least 24 hours is recommended.

====== Gateway implementation

The relationships between the Gateway component, WIS2 and SWIM are
illustrated in figure 2 (below) footnote:[Note that figure 2 simplifies
the transmission of discovery metadata from WIS2 Node to the Global
Discovery Catalogue. In reality, the WIS Node publishes notification
messages advertising the availability of new discovery metadata resource
at a given URL. These messages are republished by the Global Broker. The
Global Discovery Catalogue subscribes to a Global Broker and downloads
the discovery metadata from the WIS2 Node using the URL supplied in the
message.].

{empty}[Figure 2: interactions between the Gateway and components of WIS
2.0 and SWIM]

======= Configuration

Discovery metadata about the aviation weather datasets will provide
useful information that can be used to configure the Gateway, e.g., the
topic(s) to subscribe to plus various other information that may be
needed for the aviation weather SWIM service.

Discovery metadata can be downloaded from the Global Discovery Catalogue.

======= Functions

The Gateway component implements the following functions:


* Subscribe to the pertinent topic(s) for notifications about new
aviation weather datafootnote:[WIS 2.0 recommends that one subscribes to
notifications from a Global Broker. However, where both Gateway and WIS
Node are operated by the same organisation, it may be advantageous to
subscribe directly to the local message broker of WIS Node, e.g., to
reduce latency.].
* On receipt of notification messages about aviation weather data:
[lowerroman]
** parse the notification message, discarding duplicate messages already
processed previously;
** download the aviation weather data resource from the WIS2
Nodefootnote:[The WIS2 Node may control access to data - the Gateway will
need to be implemented accordingly.] using the URL in the message - the
resource should be in IWXXM format;
** create a new "data message" as per the SWIM specifications, including
the unique identifier extracted from the data resourcefootnote:[In case
a unique identifier is required for proper passing of an aviation
weather message to the Gateway, one can use the GTS abbreviated heading
(TTAAii CCCC YYGGgg) in the COLLECT envelop (available in IWXXM messages
having a corresponding TAC message), or content in attribute
``gml:identifier`` (available in newer IWXXM messages like WAFS SIGWX
Forecast and QVACI), for such purpose. There is currently no agreed
definition for unique identifier of IWXXM METAR and TAF reports of
individual aerodrome.], and embedding the aviation weather data resource
within the data message;
** publish the data message to the appropriate topic on the SWIM Message
Broker component of the SWIM service.

The choice of protocol for publishing to the SWIM Message Broker should
be based on bilateral agreement between operators of the Gateway and
SWIM service.

The Gateway should implement logging and error handling as necessary to
enable reliable operations. WIS2 uses the OpenMetrics
standardfootnote:[OpenMetrics - see
https://openmetrics.io[[.underline]#https://openmetrics.io#]] for
publishing metrics and other operating information. Use of OpenMetrics
by the Gateway would enable monitoring and performance reporting to be
easily integrated into the WIS2 system.

======= Operation

The Gateway may be operated at national or regional level depending on
the organisational governance in place.

====== SWIM service

The SWIM aviation weather information service comprises a Message Broker
component which implements the AMQP 1.0 messaging standardfootnote:[AMQP
1.0 - see https://www.amqp.org/resources/specifications].

The Message Broker publishes the data messages provided by the Gateway.

The Message Broker must ensure that data messages are provided only by
authorized sources such as a Gateway.
