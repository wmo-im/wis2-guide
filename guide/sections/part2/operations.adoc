==== Interoperability with existing systems

The WIS 2.0 priciples enable lowering the barrier to weather/climate/water data for WMO members.  Lowering the barrier is driven by **international standards**
for data discovery, access, and visualization.  In addition to Member benefits, a by-product of utilizing standards is being able to provide
the same data and access mechanisms to external systems at no extra cost of implementation.

WIS 2.0 standards are based on industry standards (OGC, W3C, IETF) and allow for **broad** interoperabliilty.  This means that non-traditional users can also
use data from WIS 2.0 data in the same manner, without the requirement for specialized software, tools, or applications.
