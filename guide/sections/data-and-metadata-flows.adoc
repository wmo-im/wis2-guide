== Data and metadata flows in WIS2

This section provides a visual overview of how data and discovery metadata are shared within WIS2.

Figure 2 introduces the symbology used throughout this section. TODO: crossref

.Symbology used to describe data and metadata flows
image::images/symbology-data-metadata-flows.png[Symbology used to describe data and metadata flows]

Introducing the key components:

* *MQ Broker*: Used to publish messages advertising the availability of new/updated/deleted discovery metadata and new Data Objects (e.g. data files that comprise the dataset). Implements MQTT 3.1.1 and/or MQTT 5.0.
* *Data server*: Provides mechanism for Data Consumers to download datasets or part thereof. May be implemented by publishing Data Objects (files) to a Web server or FTP server. Or as an interactive API. Supported protocols are HTTPS and SFTP.   
* *Catalogue*: Contains discovery metadata records describing the datasets published by the NC/DCPC. May be implemented as a "static catalogue" with JSON files published on a Web server enabling a user to browse the catalogue, or as a "dynamic catalogue" via an application that offers a search API.

=== Simple NC/DCPC data sharing

Here we introduce the key concepts of publishing discovery metadata, notification messages, and data. For simplicity, the WIS2 Global Services are not shown here.  

Figure 3 illustrates metadata publication and discovery by a Data Consumer.

.Simple NC/DCPC data sharing - metadata and discovery
image::images/simple-nc-dcpc-data-sharing-metadata-discovery.png[Simple NC/DCPC data sharing - metadata and discovery]

. NC/DCPC shares a new dataset. They publish a discovery metadata record (*R*) to their local catalogue describing this dataset.
. Data Consumer searches/browses the NC/DCPC’s local catalogue and discover a dataset that they need. They use the links to identify how & where they can download the dataset and subscribe to updates (e.g., when new data is added to the dataset).
. This is a near-real-time dataset that will be routinely updated. The Data Consumer decides to subscribe to the topic for this dataset on the NC/DCPC’s local MQ broker.
. Later, NC/DCPC updates the scope of the dataset (e.g. adding data from another observing station). They publish an updated discovery metadata record (*R\**) to their local catalogue

Note: Data Consumer does not need to update their subscription to receive messages about data availability from this new observing station. They have subscribed to updates about the *dataset* - which now includes data from the additional observing station.

Figure 4 illustrates how a Data Consumer subscribes to receive notification messages and responds to receipt of a message by downloading data.

.Figure 4 Simple NC/DCPC data sharing - data distribution
image::images/simple-nc-dcpc-data-sharing-data-distribution.png[Simple NC/DCPC data sharing - data distribution]

. [Precondition] Data Consumer subscribes to the MQ topic at the NC/DCPC.
. As the dataset is produced Data Objects (*D*), e.g., observation data BUFR-files, are made available for download, and messages (*m^D^*) are published to the topic for this dataset on the local MQ broker.
. Message (*m^D^*) indicating availability of new data are pushed to the subscriber.
. Data Consumer parses the messages to extract the URL for the new Data Object (*D*) and downloads the file.

Note: In this example, the dataset is published as files that can be downloaded – but the same pattern can be used to advertise new data that is made available via an API.  

=== Message distribution via Global Broker

Here we add the Global Broker service.

Note that the Global Broker operates two "channels": one for messages originating from NC or DCPCs, the second for messages from Global Cache instances. These are designated "O" and "GC" accordingly.
Figure 5 illustrates how messages are published from the NC/DCPC to the Global Broker.
 
.Message distribution via Global Broker - publishing messages from NC/DCPC
image::images/message-distribution-via-gb-publishing-from-nc-dcpc.png[Message distribution via Global Broker - publishing messages from NC/DCPC]

. A[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Broker with a config file that indicates (i) NC/DCPCs and Global Cache instances from which to re-publish messages, and (ii) connection details for at least two other Global Broker instances.
. B[Precondition] Global Broker determines the MQ broker topics to subscribe to and subscribes to them.
. As the dataset is produced Data Objects (*D*), e.g., observation data BUFR-files, are made available for download, and messages (*m^D^*) are published to the topic for this dataset on the local MQ broker.
. Message (*m^D^*) indicating availability of new data are pulled by the subscriber.
. Message (*m^D^*) is assessed using "anti-loop" logic to avoid resending duplicate messages. If approved, it is added to the appropriate MQ topic of the "originating centre" channel of Global Broker.
. Message (*m^D^*) is validated against the agreed message format (insert reference). If the message is not compliant, it is discarded.

Figure 6 illustrates how messages are propagated to other Global Broker instances.
 
.Message distribution via Global Broker – publishing messages from other Global Brokers
image::images/message-distribution-via-gb-publishing-from-other-gb.png[Message distribution via Global Broker – publishing messages from other Global Broker]

. A[Precondition] Global Broker instances subscribe to MQ topics from at least 2 other Global Broker instances. These are not necessarily bilateral relationships.
. B[Precondition] Message (*m^D^*) already (re-)published by Global Broker #1.
. Message (*m^D^*) is pulled by subscriber: Global Broker #2. This is not a duplicate message, so GB#2 republishes the message.
. Message (*m^D^*) is pulled by subscribers: Global Broker instances #1, #3 and #4. GB#3 and GB#4 have not seen this message before, so they republish the message. However, GB#1 identifies the message as a duplicate and discards it.
. Message (*m^D^*) is made available to subscribers from Global Broker instances #3 and #4. All Global Broker instances already have a copy of the message, so the new copy of the message is discarded thereby avoiding publication of duplicate messages.

=== Data distribution via Global cache

Here we add the Global Cache service.

Figure 7 illustrates how "data availability" notification messages are published by a Global Cache instance once it has downloaded a copy of a data object from an NC or DCPC.

.Data distribution via Global Cache – publishing "data availability" messages
image::images/data-distribution-via-gb-publishing-data-availability-messages.png[Data distribution via Global Cache – publishing "data availability" messages]


. A[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Broker with a configuration that indicates (i) NC/DCPCs and Global Cache instances from which to re-publish messages, and (ii) connection details for at least two other Global Broker instances.
. B[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Cache with a configuration that indicates connection details for at least one Global Broker instance, the list of datasets that need to be cached, and the list of NC/DCPC for which this instance serves as a primary Global Cache.
. C[Pre-condition] Global Broker determines the MQ broker topics to subscribe to and subscribes to them.
. D[Pre-condition] Global Cache determines the MQ broker topics to subscribe to and subscribes to them.
. As the dataset is produced Data Objects (*D*) are made available for download, and messages (*m^D^*) are published to the topic for this dataset on the local MQ broker.
. Message (*m^D^*) indicating availability of new data are pushed to the subscriber.
. Message (*m^D^*) is not a duplicate, so Global Broker republishes it.
. Message (*m^D^*) indicating availability of new data are pushed to the subscriber.
. Global Cache parses the message and downloads the Data Object (*D*).
. Global Cache adds Data Object (*D*) to its data server and publishes a "data availability" message (*m^D^*) that advertises data availability from the Global Cache instance.
. Message (*m^D^*) indicating availability of new data are pushed to the subscriber.
. Message (*m^D^*) is not a duplicate, so Global Broker republishes it – this time on the Global Cache channel.
. Messages (mD, mD) are pushed to other Global Broker instances and re-published there.

Figure 8 illustrates how data propagates between Global Cache instances.

. Data distribution via Global Cache – propagating data between Global Cache instances
image::images/data-distribution-via-gb-propagating-data-between-gbs.png[Data distribution via Global Cache – propagating data between Global Cache instances]

. A[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Caches with a configuration that indicates connection details for at least one Global Broker instance and the list of datasets that need to be cached.
. B[Pre-condition] Global Cache determines the MQ broker topics to subscribe to and subscribes to them.
. C[Pre-condition] NC/DCPC has published Data Object (*D*) and messages (*m^D^*) advertising availability of that Data Object.
. D[Pre-condition] Global Cache #1 has downloaded Data Object (*D*) and published "data availability" message (*m^D^*).
. E[Pre-condition] Global Broker has re-published "data availability" messages from NC/DCPC and Global Cache instance #1 (mD, mD).
. Global Cache #2 subscribes to both channels on the Global Broker. Both messages advertising Data Object (mD, mD) are pushed to GC#2. Message (*m^D^*) arrives first, so message (*m^D^*) is discarded as a duplicate.
. Global Cache #2 parses the message and downloads the Data Object (*D*) from GC#1.
. GC#2 adds Data Object (*D*) to its data server and publishes a "data availability" message (m2) that advertises data availability from GC#2.
. Global Broker also subscribes to GC#2 (details not shown for brevity). New "data availability" message (m2) is pushed to the Global Broker and added to the "Global Cache" channel. It is not a duplicate of message (*m^D^*) because it refers to a different download location – GC#2 not GC#1. Both messages (mD, m2) are published to the same topic on the Global Cache channel, so subscribers to that topic will receive multiple messages.
. Messages (mD, mD, m2) are pushed to other Global Broker instances and re-published there.

=== Populating the Global Catalogue

Here we add the Global Discovery Catalogue service.

Figure 9 illustrates how discovery metadata records propagate from the NC or DCPC via a Global Cache instance to the Global Discovery Catalogue.

.Populating the Global Catalogue with discovery metadata records
image::images/populating-gdc-records.png[Populating the Global Catalogue with discovery metadata records]

. A[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Broker with a configuration that indicates (i) NC/DCPCs and Global Cache instances from which to re-publish messages, and (ii) connection details for at least two other Global Broker instances.
. B[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Cache with a configuration that indicates connection details for at least one Global Broker instance, the list of datasets that need to be cached, and the list of NC/DCPC for which this instance serves as a primary Global Cache.
. C[Pre-condition] Bootstrap the Global Catalogue with a configuration that indicates connection details for at least one Global Broker instance.
. D[Pre-condition] Global Broker, Global Cache, and Global Catalogue determine MQ broker topics to subscribe to and subscribes to them. Global Catalogue subscribes only to the "Global Cache" channel.
. NC/DCPC publishes a discovery metadata record (R) to their local catalogue describing the dataset they are sharing.
. NC/DCPC advertises the availability of this metadata record by publishing a message (*m^R^*) to the ‘metadata’ topic on the local MQ broker.
. Message (*m^R^*) indicating the availability of new metadata is pushed to the Global Broker. The Global Broker republishes the message on the metadata topic of the "Originating Centre" channel.
. Message (*m^R^*) indicating the availability of new metadata is pushed to the Global Cache.
. Global Cache parses the message and downloads the discovery metadata record (R).
. Global Cache adds discovery metadata record (R) to its data server and publishes a message (*m^R^*) that advertises availability of the record from the Global Cache instance.
. Message (*m^R^*) indicating availability of new metadata at the Global Cache is pushed to the Global Broker. The Global Broker republishes the message on the metadata topic of the "Global Cache" channel.
. Message (*m^R^*) indicating the availability of new metadata at the Global Cache is pushed to the Global Catalogue.
. Global Catalogue parses the message (*m^R^*) indicating the availability of new metadata, asserts that this is not a duplicate message, and downloads the discovery metadata record (R) from the Global Cache. It does not matter which Global Cache instance the record is downloaded from – a Global Cache will only publish a message (*m^R^*) when they hold a copy of record (R).
. Global Catalogue creates a copy of the original record (new record is R*) and adds links indicating where Data Consumers can subscribe for updates to this dataset at each Global Broker instance. Global Catalogue adds record R* to the catalogue.

=== Data distribution including the Global Services

Here we bring all the components together to show how data is distributed from NCs or DCPCs to Data Consumers in WIS2. See Figure 10.

.Data distribution with Global Services
image::images/data-distribution-with-global-services.png[Data distribution with Global Services]

Pre-conditions:

* WIS2 Global Service Components are correctly configured and operating.
* NC/DCPC has published a discovery metadata record (R) to their local catalogue describing the dataset they are sharing. This record has propagated to the Global Catalogue, where an amended metadata record (R*) is published. Record (R*) includes additional actionable links to Global Broker instances where Data Consumers can subscribe for updates to the dataset.
. Data Consumer searches/browses the Global Catalogue and discovers a dataset that they need. Discovery metadata record (R*) provides  links indicating how and where to download the data set and/or subscribe to updates.
  A. Download from NC/DCPC.
  B. Subscribe to updates from NC/DCPC local MQ broker.
  C. Subscribe to updates from Global Broker’s "Originating Centre" channel.
  D. Subscribe to updates from Global Broker’s "Global Cache" channel.
. Data Consumer wants to download Data Objects from the Global Cache, so decides to subscribe to dataset updates from the Global Broker’s "Global Cache" channel.
. [Data Object publication and propagation to Global Cache instances]
  * NC/DCPC has published Data Object (*D*) as part of their dataset. Data Object (*D*) is propagated to Global Cache #1 and Global Cache #2.
  * NC/DCPC has published a message (*m^D^*) advertising availability of Data Object (*D*).
  * GC#1 has published a message (*m^D^*) advertising availability of Data Object (*D*).
  * #2 has published a message (m2) advertising availability of Data Object (*D*).
  * Global Broker has republished message (*m^D^*) on its "Originating Centre" channel, and messages (mD, m2) on its "Global Cache" channel.
. Messages (mD, m2) are pushed to the subscriber. Message (*m^D^*) arrives second, so it is discarded.
. Data Consumer parses the message (m2) to extract the URL for the new Data Object (*D*) hosted on GC#2 and downloads the Data Object.
